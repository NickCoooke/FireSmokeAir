Here is the agenda for the development of FireSmokeAir`
# To Do

## InfoBox
- Fix centering on cards
- Add images for tags
- Add sorting feature for tags
- Add topical Blocks: overview of topic and notes on how to research. Ex, clean rooms
- Color links by danger: use these links in these situations. Ex, red would have links on how to make DIY clean rooms and find masks that work

## Map
- Add A floating Key explaining the colors 
- Add location search
- Connect to AirNow for current Data
- Connect to purple air for more Data
- Format and store data in temp back end files

## Side Bar
- Populate with location information: (Air quality, Location name, nearest sensor)
- Color based off of result (like we do with point population)
